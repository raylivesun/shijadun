[TTST] Role Creation Update

Hey @everyone!

Following up on our recent Role Progression Announcement, we’d like to share a quick update regarding the implementation of these roles.

At this time, only the [L|SBC] Senior Bus Captain role will be created and available in the group. The remaining roles (such as [L|CBC], [L|RT], [L|SPV], and [MR|OC]) will be added progressively once we have sufficient Robux to create and manage them properly.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work on expanding TTST's structure and systems step by step. 

Stay tuned for more updates — and keep clocking those minutes!
