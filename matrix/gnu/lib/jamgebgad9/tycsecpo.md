TTST Role Progression Update

Hey @everyone!

We’re excited to roll out the official role progression system at TTST! Starting today, certain roles can only be unlocked by accumulating shift minutes and, in some cases, completing route training.

This system ensures that promotions are based on dedication, experience, and performance, rewarding those who put in the time and effort.

**Driver Progression (based on shift minutes)
These roles will be unlocked as you log more shift minutes and maintain high performance standards:
**
◾ [L|SBC] Senior Bus Captain – 300 shift minutes
For experienced drivers who’ve shown consistency. You’ll also help guide and support new Bus Captains.

◾ [L|CBC] Chief Bus Captain – 500 shift minutes
Recognizes outstanding driving skills and professionalism. A key milestone before entering the management path.

◾ [L|RT] Route Tester – 700 shift minutes + Route Training Required
Test upcoming routes and provide feedback. Route training must be completed to qualify for this role.

◾ [L|SPV] Supervisor – 900 shift minutes + Route Training Required
A leadership role at the line level. Supervisors oversee driver conduct, ensure shift quality, and support operational needs.

**Management Track (MR Entry)
For those ready to step into operational leadership:**

◾ [MR|OC] Operations Coordinator – 2,000 shift minutes + Route Training Required
A major role where you'll assist with day-to-day operations, help manage logs, and support frontline staff.

**Note: Make sure all your shift minutes are properly logged and verified by the admins.  **
