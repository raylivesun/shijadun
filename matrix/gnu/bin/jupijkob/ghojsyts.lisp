  The documenatation lisp Nvim supports the languages
  Servers Protocol (LSP), which means it cats as a 
  client to lsp servers and includes a lua framework
  `vim.lsp' for building enchanced LSP tools.

  https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/

  LSP facilitates features like go-to-definitation, 
  find references, hover completetion, rename, format,   refactor, etc, using semantic whole-project analysis
  (unlike ctags).
