ðŸ“¢ Official Announcement â€“ Update on Shift Sheet

Dear TTST Members,

We hope this message finds you well.

It has come to our attentionâ€”thanks to some of our attentive traineesâ€”that the current shift sheet contains inconsistencies due to it being copied from a previous version. We acknowledge this oversight and appreciate those who brought it to our notice.

In light of this, and to avoid any further confusion or conflict, we have decided to create a new shift sheet. This will ensure clarity, fairness, and better alignment with current team requirements.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

Thank you for your continued support.

Warm regards,
TTST Management
