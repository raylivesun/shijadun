**Refining README Sections**

I've been meticulously deconstructing the request. I'm focusing on the implied sections for a standard README.md file: Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and License.  The LISP language element is pivotal and will be incorporated into the sections. I'm planning out the content strategy now.


**Outlining Section Content**

I'm now outlining specific content for each README section. The focus is on the LISP implementation, assumed to be named "shijadun."  I'm drafting the "Description," "Installation," and "Usage" sections with the LISP/Dlang combination in mind, highlighting their roles. The "Contributing" section is also being planned. I'm focusing on the project's essence for each section.


**Defining Core Project Elements**

I've shifted focus to defining the core elements. I'm thinking about the relationship between LISP and D in the project. The likely scenario, a LISP interpreter written in D, is now the primary hypothesis. I'm preparing to flesh out the README sections with a clear overview. The name *shijadun* seems to be the focus for now.


**Elaborating the Project Definition**

My thinking has moved towards a refined project definition. I've concluded that *shijadun* will be a LISP dialect implemented in D. I'm focusing on the README sections and envisioning an initial, simple version with core LISP primitives and a REPL. I'm now structuring the README with the project's features and goals in mind.


**Expanding Feature Scope**

Now I'm expanding my understanding of the features to be included. I'm considering features like basic data types, a REPL environment, and file execution capabilities. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for further development.  I'm also considering the implications of performance and ease of use.


**Expanding the LISP Interpreter Definition**

I'm now focusing on what *shijadun* should be. I've decided it'll be a basic Scheme-like LISP interpreter. My focus is on the essential features: core LISP primitives, a REPL, and file execution capabilities. I'm now outlining how the language will work, ensuring a practical and understandable starting point.


**Expanding README Structure**

I'm now revising the entire README structure. I'm focusing on defining sections such as the title and description, as well as the 'About', 'Features', 'Installation', and 'Usage'. The project will be an interpreter written in D, implementing the LISP dialect. I'm writing illustrative usage examples.
