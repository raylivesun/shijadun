Okay, here's a template for a `README.md` file for a project named "shijadun" which is a LISP language implementation (or related tool) using the Dlang language.

I'll make some assumptions:
*   "shijadun" is the name of your LISP dialect or the interpreter itself.
*   It's primarily an interpreter, possibly with a REPL.
*   You'll be using D's package manager, `dub`.

You'll need to fill in the specifics for your project.

**Shijadun is a [describe what it is - e.g., lightweight, embeddable, experimental] LISP dialect interpreter implemented in the D programming language.**

This project aims to [state your primary goal - e.g., explore LISP implementation techniques, create a performant LISP for D, provide a learning tool, etc.]. It leverages D's features like [mention D's strengths you're using - e.g., performance, metaprogramming, safety, C interop] to build a robust and [adjective] LISP environment.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):** Interactive environment for trying out Shijadun LISP code.
*   **Core LISP Primitives:** `define`, `lambda`, `if`, `cond`, `quote`, `set!`, `begin`, etc.
*   **Basic Data Types:** Numbers (integers, floats), Strings, Symbols, Booleans, Lists, Pairs.
*   **Arithmetic and Logical Operations:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `<`, `>`, `and`, `or`, `not`.
*   **List Manipulation:** `car`, `cdr`, `cons`, `list`, `append`, `length`, etc.
*   **File Execution:** Load and execute Shijadun LISP scripts from files.
*   **[Add more features as you implement them - e.g., Macros, FFI, Tail Call Optimization, Garbage Collection details, specific libraries]**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A D compiler:
    *   [DMD](https://dlang.org/download.html#dmd) (reference compiler)
    *   [LDC](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases) (LLVM-based, often better for performance)
    *   [GDC](https://gdcproject.org/) (GCC-based)
*   [DUB](https://code.dlang.org/download) - D's package and build manager (usually comes with the compiler).
*   Git (for cloning the repository).

### Installation & Building

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/shijadun.git
    cd shijadun
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    *   For a debug build:
        ```bash
        dub build
        ```
    *   For a release (optimized) build:
        ```bash
        dub build -b release
        ```
    The executable will typically be found in the `bin/` directory (e.g., `./bin/shijadun`).

## üíª Usage

### Running the REPL

To start the interactive Shijadun LISP REPL:

```bash
./bin/shijadun
```
or if `dub build` placed it in the current directory:
```bash
./shijadun
```

You should see a prompt like `shijadun> `.

**Example REPL Session:**
```lisp
shijadun> (+ 1 2 3)
6
shijadun> (define (factorial n)
            (if (<= n 1)
                1
                (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
<procedure:factorial>
shijadun> (factorial 5)
120
shijadun> (exit) ; or Ctrl+D to exit
```

### Executing a Script File

To execute a Shijadun LISP script file (e.g., `examples/hello.sjd` or `examples/hello.lisp`):

```bash
./bin/shijadun examples/your_script.sjd
```

**Example Script (`examples/hello.sjd`):**
```lisp
(define (greet name)
  (display "Hello, ")
  (display name)
  (display " from Shijadun LISP!")
  (newline))

(greet "World")
```

## üìñ Shijadun LISP Language (Brief Overview)

*(This section should detail any specifics about your LISP dialect if it differs significantly from common LISPs like Scheme or Common Lisp. If it's fairly standard, you can keep this brief or point to external LISP learning resources.)*

*   **Syntax:** S-expressions `(operator operand1 operand2 ...)`.
*   **Comments:** Semicolons `;` denote comments to the end of the line.
*   **Special Forms:** `define`, `lambda`, `if`, `quote`, `set!`, `begin`, `cond`, etc.
*   **Built-in Procedures:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `car`, `cdr`, `cons`, `list`, `display`, `newline`, etc.
*   **Data Types:**
    *   Numbers: `123`, `3.14`
    *   Strings: `"hello world"`
    *   Symbols: `my-symbol`, `a`
    *   Booleans: `#t` (true), `#f` (false)
    *   Lists: `(1 2 3)`, `(a b (c d))`
    *   The empty list: `'()` or `nil` (decide on your convention)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Status

Shijadun is currently in **[Alpha/Beta/Early Development/Maintenance]** stage.
Expect [bugs, frequent changes, missing features].

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap / TODO

*   [ ] Implement macros system.
*   [ ] Add more built-in functions (e.g., string manipulation, file I/O).
*   [ ] Improve error reporting.
*   [ ] Write more comprehensive tests.
*   [ ] Proper Garbage Collection (if not already robust).
*   [ ] FFI for calling D/C functions.
*   [ ] Documentation for the Shijadun LISP dialect.
*   [ ] Performance optimizations.

*Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è and Dlang*
```

**Key things to customize:**

1.  **`<your-github-username>`:** Replace this in the CI badge URL and clone URL.
2.  **Project Description:** Tailor the first paragraph to accurately describe Shijadun.
3.  **Features:** List the actual features your LISP has or will have.
4.  **Shijadun LISP Language Section:** If your LISP has unique characteristics, detail them here.
5.  **Development Status:** Be honest about where the project is.
6.  **Roadmap/TODO:** Outline your plans.
7.  **DUB Package:** If you plan to publish to `code.dlang.org`, update the DUB badge and ensure your `dub.json` or `dub.sdl` is configured for publishing.
8.  **Script Extension:** I used `.sjd` as an example. Use whatever extension you prefer for your LISP files (e.g., `.lisp`, `.scm`).
9.  **CI Workflow:** The badge assumes a GitHub Actions workflow named `d.yml`. You'll need to create this file (e.g., in `.github/workflows/d.yml`) to set up continuous integration. A basic one might look like:

    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/d.yml
    name: D Language CI

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      build:
        strategy:
          matrix:
            os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
            dc: [dmd-latest, ldc-latest]
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Setup D ${{ matrix.dc }}
            uses: dlang-community/setup-dlang@v1
            with:
              compiler: ${{ matrix.dc }}

          - name: Run tests
            run: dub test

          - name: Build release
            run: dub build -b release
    ```
10. **LICENSE File:** Create a `LICENSE` file in your repository root containing the MIT License text (or your chosen license).

This template provides a solid foundation. Good luck with your Shijadun LISP project!
